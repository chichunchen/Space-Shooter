## Some things to say:

This project is my java project in my java class in NCTU. It has no well-designed artichture or elaborately algorithm, but by doing this project, I truly understand what object oriented is like, how important version control is, and a lot a lot more.

Teenage as I am, making a game project by my own hand really means a lot to me, and I am sure that I'll dedicated my self into this area untill I am not able to type XD.
